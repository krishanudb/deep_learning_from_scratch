# using numpy to make basic neural networks.

This repository contains python code for making simple neural networks from scratch using numpy.

The code will be very useful as it develops the intuition behind the neural network algorithms.

Initially we will be looking at fully connected neural networks only, but will gradually move on to more complicated ones like convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks.

In case of any doubts, please raise issues or reach out to krish.dblogger@gmail.com (subject: "deep learning from scratch issues")

We really hope that this page is useful to learners.
